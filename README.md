# Image-Manipulation-over-Voice-Commands
voice commands are used for basic image editing. We call it Elements. Elements is capable of Edit images all over voice commands.

# Welcome to Image Editing Using Voice Command.

## Abstract
Image editing encompasses the processes of altering images, whether they are digital photographs, traditional photo-chemical photographs, or illustrations. Traditional analog image editing is known as photo retouching, using tools such as an airbrush to modify photographs or editing illustrations with any traditional art medium. Graphic software programs can be broadly categorized into vector graphics editors, raster graphics editors, and 3D modelers. _This software is a primary tool with which a user may manipulate, enhance, and transform images_. Many image editing programs are used to render or create computer art from scratch via direct interaction. **We use voice commands and direct interaction to edit Images.**

## Introduction 
Image editing from scratch has become a timeconsuming process for non-professionals as well as for upgrading professionals. _Learning chunks of shortcuts and completely accessing editing tools via mouse and keyboard has become difficult, timeconsuming, and particularly overhead for at least a few_. Here, **we introduce an image editing interface that comprises of vocal command recognizer**, however, image editing is difficult to perform with voice alone.  For flexible and easy editing-control _we use both voice and manual editing interaction_, using mouse and keyboard. Selecting an object or a layer within the workspace has become easier. The editing panel is a grid fashion workspace and x-y axes (rulers) are scaled for selection of points at the workspace where an image is to be edited. This application contains an image storage directory linked to the desktop so that importing images becomes easy which is already in the application storage. There are combinations of filters that provide a professional touch to the images. Elements like adding texts and formatting, color-comb are add-on features. The functions with varying values can be adjusted in percentage/values by saying it while specifying the arguments. **Voice interface makes complex tasks easier and accessible as they allow users to simply state goals without learning an interface.**
